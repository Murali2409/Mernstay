# Mernstay
Mernstay is a MERN stack-based hotel booking platform, replicating Airbnb's core features. It utilizes MongoDB for data storage, Express.js for server-side logic, React for a dynamic user interface, and Node.js for runtime environment.

The database for properties and users is contained within the MongoDB database. The server-side logic and API endpoints are managed by Express.js. To create a dynamic and responsive experience for property listings and bookings, React is used. Through Node.js, the front-end and back-end communicate with each other in real time. 

Node.js acts as a runtime environment for executing things on the server side making communication between server and client possible. There is modular design in place where there are user authentication, property searching and booking components. In the course of the task, redux has been added to ensure effective data transfer in the program. Furthermore, its communication between the client and server in this project is based on RESTful API principles.
